### - [pytest-bdd]: steps should be as small and as unique as possible to avoid conflict
`Given I register a new card with 1000 initial amount with active status`
 will conflict with
 `Given I register a new card with 1000 initial amount`
 
 Its better to break them into two steps
 ```
 Given I register a new card
 And I set the card amount to 1000
 And I set the card status to active
 ```
 
### - pytest factory function
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def new_account_payload():
    class AccountFactory:
        def create(self):
            return {
                "product_code": "TESTAA",
                "mobile_number": f'{random.randrange(1, 10 ** 10):10}'.replace(" ", "").zfill(10),
                "first_name": "TEST",
                "last_name": "TEST",
                "birthday": "22031982",
                "load_amount": "0",
                "billing_amount": "0",
                "card_activation_flag": "N"
            }

    return AccountFactory()
```
Usage:
```
def step_new_account(new_account_payload):
    payload = new_account_payload.create()
    ...
```
